## Hey there, I'm Saameh!
🧠 I’m a neurobiology and neuroimaging (junior) researcher currently working on tfMRI-based working-memory modeling.

👩‍💻 I can code in Python and R in Linux environments and Windows (I know, lame ...) and I'm working to expand my computational skills.

📨 You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saameh-sanaaee/) or [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/saamehsanaaee.bsky.social)!
