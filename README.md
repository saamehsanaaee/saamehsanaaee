## Hey there, I'm Saameh!
🧠 I’m a neurobiology and neuroimaging \[junior\] researcher currently working as an independant researcher with a wonderful team.

👩‍💻 Currently, I'm working with fMRI data and building a model of working memory (a major part of our short-term memory) and learning about how the brain manages information in real time. I'm mainly using Python and, well ... a bit of luck!
