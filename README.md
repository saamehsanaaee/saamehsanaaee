## Hey there, I'm Saameh!
🧠 I’m a neurobiology and neuroimaging (junior) researcher currently working on tfMRI-based working-memory modeling.

👩‍💻 Currently, I'm working in Python and R (mostly through Jupyter Lab and R Studio), familiarzing myself with Unix environments, and trying to expand my computational comfort zone.
